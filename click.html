            Radha, a dreaded gangster, and his men plan a heist at "Your Bank", one of the biggest privately-owned bank in Chennai,
             with the support of ACP Ramachandran. They plan to rob ₹500 crore on 21st May, coinciding with the Governor's party event at his residence. On the day of the heist, Radha and his men hijack the bank, only to realize that a mysterious person named "Michael Jackson" and his accomplice, Kanmani, have already hijacked the bank. The commandos arrive at the bank, only for them to be defeated by Michael Jackson. He later makes a deal with Radha to help him rob ₹5000 crores, in exchange for a share of the money, for which he and his men relucantly agree.
        
             When Radha finds that the bank locker contains ₹1510 crores, they decide to kill Michael Jackson, but are defeated by him. Ramachandran tries to negotiate with Michael Jackson, but the latter wants Antony alias Anto, a police constable, to negotiate with him. Ramachandran tries to kill Michael Jackson with a sniper, only for him to make an explosion in a car parked nearby the bank, using a bomb. With the events being leaked to the media, city commissioner Dayalan is called in to handle the situation. While inspecting the bank, Michael finds explosives, disguised as fire extinguishers, and deduces that a third team has also entered the bank, without him knowing.

The film was shot mostly in Chennai and Hyderabad, with sporadic schedules in Visakhapatnam, Bellary and Ladakh.

Varisu was released in theatres worldwide on 11 January 2023, in the week of Pongal, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film has grossed ₹220–250 crore at the box ofiice.
The story for the film was written keeping Mahesh Babu in mind and when the actor could not sign up for the film, the makers approached Allu Arjun, Prabhas and Ram Charan before finalising Vijay.[27] In October 2021, Prakash Raj was reported to play a key role in the film, collaborating with Vijay after over a decade since Villu (2009).[28][29] On 5 April 2022, the birthday of Rashmika Mandanna, it was announced that she would be the lead actress.[30] It is her second Tamil film after Sulthan (2021).[31] The makers initially wanted Pooja Hegde as the lead actress, but ultimately desisted since she was doing consecutive films with stars; Hegde had previously starred with Vijay in Beast (2022).[32] R. Sarathkumar joined the cast the day after Mandanna's announcement.[33]

On 26 April 2022, Shaam confirmed being a part of the film,[34] and the following week, Yogi Babu also confirmed his presence in the film.[35] Five days later, the production house confirmed Prabhu and Jayasudha as part of the cast,[36] and two days later, Telugu actor Srikanth,[37] Sangeetha Krish and Samyuktha Shanmughanathan.[38] In early June, a photograph of Khushbu on the sets was leaked.[39] Though she initially denied being part of the cast,[40] her presence was confirmed on 26 October.[41] According to Vijay, her role is minor.[42]: 9:40  Khushbu's scenes were excluded from the theatrical cut due to length issues.[43] On 23 August, Ganesh Venkatraman confirmed his presence in the film.[44] In September, Sriman was confirmed to be a part of the film.[45] At the film's audio launch on 24 December, Vijay announced that S. J. Suryah would play a minor role, which he accepted for Vijay's sake.[42]: 9:45–10:20

                    Ponniyin Selvan: I (transl. The Son of Ponni) is a 2022 Indian Tamil-language epic historical action adventure film directed by Mani Ratnam, who co-wrote it with Elango Kumaravel and B. Jeyamohan. Produced by Ratnam and Subaskaran Allirajah under Madras Talkies and Lyca Productions, it is the first of two cinematic parts based on Kalki Krishnamurthy's 1955 novel, Ponniyin Selvan. The film stars an ensemble cast including Vikram, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Jayam Ravi, Karthi, Trisha, Jayaram, Aishwarya Lekshmi, Sobhita Dhulipala, Prabhu, R. Sarathkumar, Vikram Prabhu, Prakash Raj, Rahman, R. Parthiban and Lal.[4] The music was composed by A. R. Rahman, with cinematography by Ravi Varman, editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, and production design by Thota Tharani. Ponniyin Selvan: I dramatizes the early life of Chola prince Arulmozhi Varman, who would become the renowned emperor Rajaraja I (947–1014).[5]

                    Ever since its publication, a film adaptation of Ponniyin Selvan had been explored by several Tamil filmmakers, including an attempt by M. G. Ramachandran in the late 1950s; however, it never materialized due to financial constraints. Decades later, Ratnam attempted to adapt the novel in the late-1980s and early-2010s but was unsuccessful. Calling it his "dream project", Ratnam revived the effort in January 2019, after Lyca agreed to fund the film. Following several changes in cast and crew, production of Ponniyin Selvan began in December 2019 and concluded in September 2021, halting twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shot in various locations across India, with a few sequences in Thailand. It was originally intended to be a single film but was split into two parts.
                    
                    Ponniyin Selvan: I was released in theatres worldwide on 30 September 2022 in standard and IMAX formats, where it received acclaim from film critics, who praised the direction, cast performances, musical score, visuals and faithfulness to the novel. Breaking several box-office records, the film grossed more than ₹500 crore (US$63 million) and became the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2022, the fourth-highest-grossing Tamil film of all time and the 15th highest-grossing Indian film of all time. It received six nominations at the 16th Asian Film Awards, including Best Film.

                        Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by James Cameron, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role.[6] New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, and Jemaine Clement. In the film, Na'vi Jake Sully (Worthington) and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the Metkayina clan of Pandora.
    
    Cameron stated in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it was successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the necessity to develop new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington, New Zealand, on September 25, 2017, and concluded in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.[2][3]
        
    Following the film's success, Cameron signed with 20th Century Fox to produce four sequels. The first sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water, was released on December 16, 2022, which received similar reviews and broke various box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of that year. Avatar 3 has completed principal filming and will be released in 2024. Further sequels are scheduled for release in 2026 and in 2028.[32] Several cast members returned, including Worthington, Saldana, Lang, and Weaver.[33][34]
