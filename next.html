            Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a 2022 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Black Panther. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Black Panther (2018) and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, the film stars Letitia Wright as Shuri / Black Panther, alongside Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Florence Kasumba, Dominique Thorne, Michaela Coel, Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Martin Freeman, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Angela Bassett. In the film, the leaders of Wakanda fight to protect their nation in the wake of King T'Challa's death.

Ideas for a sequel began after the release of Black Panther in February 2018. Coogler negotiated to return as director in the following months, and Marvel Studios officially confirmed the sequel's development in mid-2019. Plans for the film changed in August 2020 when Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, with Marvel choosing not to recast his role of T'Challa. The return of other main cast members from the first film was confirmed that November, and the title was announced in May 2021. Filming began in late June 2021 in Atlanta, taking place at both Trilith Studios and Tyler Perry Studios, before moving to Massachusetts in August, but was halted in November to allow Wright to recover from an injury sustained during filming. It resumed by mid-January 2022 and wrapped in late March in Puerto Rico.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever premiered at the El Capitan Theatre and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 26, 2022, and was released in the United States on November 11, 2022, as the final film in Phase Four of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed over $837 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2022. Bassett's performance in particular drew widespread critical acclaim, for which she won Best Supporting Actress at the 80th Golden Globe Awards, becoming the first actor to win a major individual acting award for a Marvel movie, as well as the 28th Critics' Choice Awards, where the film received six total nominations.

                The film was initially scheduled to be released in theaters on 12 August 2022, but got postponed to 15 September 2022 due to multiple injuries of actor Vishal and heavy visual effects for the fight sequences although the release date was postponed again indefinitely.[5][6] The film was released in theatres on 22 December 2022 to mixed reviews from critics who praised Vishal's performance, action sequences, soundtrack and background score but criticism aimed at its predictability.

                    RRR[a] is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It centers around two real-life Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their friendship and their fight against the British Raj. Set in the 1920s, the film tells an alternate history story exploring the undocumented period in their lives, when both the revolutionaries chose to go into obscurity before they began the fight for their country.

Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was formally announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.

Made on a budget of ₹550 crore ($72 million), RRR is the most expensive Indian film to date. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed multiple times due to production delays and the COVID pandemic. RRR was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With ₹240 crore (US$30 million) worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹415 crore (US$52 million).[6] The film grossed ₹1,200–1,258 crore worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film and second highest-grossing Telugu film worldwide.[4][7]

RRR received universal acclaim for Rajamouli's direction, writing, performances (particularly Rama Rao and Charan), soundtrack, action sequences, cinematography, editing, and visual effects. Among other accolades, RRR became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for "Naatu Naatu", making it the first Asian nomination to win the award.[8][9] It also won Best Foreign Language Film and Best Song at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review.[10]

Plot
In 1920, during the British Raj, administrator Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, a young girl with a talent for artistry, from the Gond tribe. Enraged by the act, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem, embarks to Delhi with the intent of rescuing her, under the guise of a Muslim man named Akhtar. Elsewhere, the Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists the assistance of A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the Indian Imperial Police to quell the threat. Embarking on his new assignment, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu, attend several pro-independence gatherings in the hopes of finding clues. His opinions attract the attention of Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide.

                        K.G.F: Chapter 2 is a 2022 Indian Kannada-language period action film[19] written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films. The second installment in a two-part series, it serves as a sequel to the 2018 film K.G.F: Chapter 1. The film stars an ensemble cast including Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Srinidhi Shetty, Prakash Raj, Archana Jois, Vasishta N. Simha, Achyuth Kumar, Rao Ramesh, Easwari Rao, Malavika Avinash, B. Suresha and T.S Nagabharana. It follows the assassin Rocky who after establishing himself as the kingpin of the Kolar Gold Fields, must retain his supremacy over adversaries and government officials, while also coming to terms with his past.

Produced on a budget of ₹100 crore, K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the most expensive Kannada film ever made. Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the film score and songs. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot back-to-back with Chapter 1. Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in February 2020 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later and was completed in December 2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar.

K.G.F: Chapter 2 was theatrically released in India on 14 April 2022 in Kannada, along with dubbed versions in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages. It is also the first Kannada film to release in IMAX. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the direction, action sequences, cinematography and performances (particularly Yash, Dutt and Tandon), but the pace and writing attracted criticism. It recorded the second highest-opening day in India, set domestic opening day records in Kannada, Hindi and Malayalam, and surpassed the lifetime gross of its predecessor in two days to become the highest-grossing Kannada film. With earnings of ₹1,200–1,250 crore globally,[20] K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the fourth highest-grossing Indian film worldwide, and the second highest-grossing film in India, and the second-highest-grossing Indian film of 2022.
