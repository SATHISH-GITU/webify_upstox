            Muniyandi is a narcissistic man who cares about his reputation and money, and who would go to any extent to get what he wants. His sister and Balu are in love with each other, which Muniyandi disapproves. Muniyandi's sister poisons herself and tells him that she will get married if he takes her to the hospital, but Muniyandi leaves her to die and also treats his wife Muthulakshmi poorly. Muthulakshmi finds out that her husband is having a affair, and Muniyandi tells her to put up with it. Because of the way Muniyandi treats her and her family, Muthulakshmi burns herself to death, which her young son Viruman witnesses. Enraged, Viruman chases his father with an aruva. When the court advises him not to kill Muniyandi, Viruman tells that he does not want to live with him and wants to be raised by his uncles Niraipandian and Balu.

Years later, tension and rivalry always grows between Viruman and Muniyandi, which bothers other people, specifically Viruman's brothers - Selvam, Muthukutty and Ilango. Out of respect, Viruman takes any criticism and disrespect from his brothers because he respects them. Meanwhile, Thaenmozhi "Theanu", who is Selvam's sister-in-law, praises Muniyandi due to the fact he is her sister's father-in-law and hates Viruman. However, Viruman is in love with her. When the family has a fight, she publicly defends Muniyandi. Meanwhile, Selvam needs a job and wants his father's help, which he rejects. Viruman helps him get a job with the help of MLA Pathinettaampadiyan, who forts a condition to sell his mother's land, which Viruman has always refused to sign for years but finally does so for the sake of his brothers. Thaenu realizes this and starts to reciprocate his feelings.

Their relationship is caught by Muniyandi, who starts to disrespect her and asks her to pay for the remaining dowry from her sister's marriage. While the whole village is getting involved with Selvam and Muniyandi, Viruman tells him to stop co-depending on his father as he has his own family to focus on. Selvam agrees and decides to live independently from his father. This enrages Muniyandi, who wants to fight Viruman, but Thaenu kisses Viruman, which shocks everyone. Muthukutty wants his father to sign for the auction for the restaurant, which his father rejects. His wife suggests to ask Viruman, which he is hesitant at first but later accepts. When Muniyandi finds out, he asks the village rogue Soonapaana, who slapped Muniyandi, to make Muthukutty lose the auction. When the auction happens, Viruman realizes that his father has hired Soonapaana and decides to trap him. He makes his gang chase him, and Viruman locks them up.

                Maanaadu (transl. Public Conference) is a 2021 Indian Tamil-language science fiction action thriller film written and directed by Venkat Prabhu and produced by Suresh Kamatchi. The film stars Silambarasan, S. J. Suryah and Kalyani Priyadarshan alongside S. A. Chandrasekhar, Y. G. Mahendran, Karunakaran, Premgi Amaren, Aravind Akash and Anjena Kirti in supporting roles. The film's music and score is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, with cinematography handled by Richard M. Nathan and editing done by Praveen K. L (in his 100th film). It revolves around a common man and a police officer, whom are trapped in a time loop, at the day of a public conference of the chief minister and forced to live the same day over and over again.

                The project was announced in July 2018, marking Prabhu's maiden collaboration with Silambarasan. During the extensive pre-production work, the producer ousted Silambarasan from the project in August 2019, citing his unprofessional behaviour,[4][5] and the latter announced another project under the title Maghaa Maanaadu in that month, which he had dropped.[6] The issue was resolved in November 2019, after Silambarasan agreed to allot his dates for the film.[7]
                
                Filming began on 19 February 2020 at Chennai, following a preliminary announcement about the cast and crew.[8] Despite shooting being affected twice due to the restrictions followed during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the makers wrapped the shooting of the film within July 2021, taking only 68 working days for shooting.[9] It was filmed extensively in Chennai, with sporadic schedules taking place in Pondicherry, Yercaud and Hosur.[9]
                
                Maanaadu was theatrically released worldwide on 25 November 2021. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences with praise towards cast performances (particularly S.J Suryah and STR), direction, narrative style, action sequences and technical aspects (soundtrack, editing and others). The film was highlighted for the integration of the time-loop concept with commercial elements, with many publications calling it one of the best Tamil films of 2021.[10] It was declared as critically and commercially successful at the box office.[10] A sequel is confirmed by Venkat Prabhu with the main cast returning.

                <p>
                    In Southern Tamil Nadu, two neighbouring villages Melur and Podiyankulam in Tirunelveli find themselves in constant conflict as the latter is denied a bus stop. Podiyankulam's inhabitants, who belong to the oppressed communities, are forced to use the bus stop of Melur for commuting, which irks the locals who belong to the dominant castes. Despite multiple petitions, Podiyankulam is constantly denied a bus stop thanks to the influence of Melur's local government. In 1997, Karnan, who is from Podiyankulam wins the local deity's sword as part of a competition, which had not been won for years. Weeks later, Karnan participates in an open selection camp for Reserve Police, where his grandfather Yaema Raja is worried that Karnan would lose the opportunity to join government service, if his hot-headedness would involve him in any legal trouble with the Melur villagers and is constantly looking out for him.

Within Podiyankulam, Karnan and Yaeman are considered unruly by many except its chieftain Duryodhanan, who befriends them both. This does not sit well with Vadamaalaiyan, one of the village's heads who desires to marry Karnan's sister Padmini, who is far younger than him. Vadamaalaiyan's sister Draupadhi, who is in love with Karnan, misunderstands the situation during the latter's brawl with her brother and breaks up with him. Meanwhile, tensions escalate between Melur and Podiyankulam, as Karnan along with his friends and Yaema Raja vandalises a bus for not stopping by to help a pregnant lady. The bus owner files a complaint with the police and the district's SP Kannabiran arrives on the scene. Though the bus owner and Podiyankulam's residents settle the issue amicably, the incident bruises Kannabiran's ego who feels that the villagers must always be shown their place. He asks Podiyankulam's village heads to come and sign at the area police station, only to brutally assault them for an hour and lock them up overnight. He insults them verbally and orders local police to file unrelated cases on them. Next day early morning, Karnan and others arrive to the Station and enquire about the elders. The police feign ignorance and send them out. The helper boy in the tea shop outside tells Karnan about the incidents of previous night, and Karnan storms into the Station. The guys fight off the police, find the elders on rooftop under burning sun and take them home using a confiscated tractor. Podiyankulam barriacades itself and prepares for a police attack to face the consequences of Karnan's actions.

However, the District Collector warns Kannabiran to avoid casualties at all costs. Draupadhi and Vadamaalaiyan settle their issues with Karnan, and Yaema Raja works on providing security to the villagers. However, Karnan receives his appointment letter from CRPF. He refuses to leave, but is forced to leave by Yaema Raja and the villagers, to have a better future. Minutes after Karnan leaves, the police brutally attack the village. To save his community, Yaema Raja kills himself by self-immolation, and Karnan is forced to return with sword in hand. He and Kannabiran face each other, and he traps him using the sword. He takes him hostage inside a hut, ending the clash. Karnan orders the police to bring in the MP, MLA and all important officers within an hour. Inside the hut, Kannabiran and Karnan fight, ending with Karnan overpowering Kannabiran for good.

                        Asuran (transl. Demon) is a 2019 Indian Tamil-language action drama film[4] written and directed by Vetrimaaran and produced by Kalaipuli S. Thanu. It is based on the novel Vekkai (transl. Heat) by Poomani. The film stars Dhanush, along with Manju Warrier (in her Tamil debut), Ken Karunas, and Teejay Arunasalam. G. V. Prakash Kumar composed the film's music.[5] Cinematography was handled by Velraj, with editing by R. Ramar.

                        Asuran was released in theatres on 4 October 2019.[1] The film was a commercial success at the box office.[6] The film won two awards at the 67th National Film Awards—Best Feature Film in Tamil and Best Actor (Dhanush). It was one among the ten Indian films to be screened at the 78th Golden Globe Awards (2021) under the Best Foreign Film category.[7] It was also screened at the 51st International Film Festival of India in the Indian Panorama section.[8] The film was remade in Telugu as Narappa (2021).
                        The narrator reveals that the man is Sivasaami and the boy is his son Chidambaram. In contrast, the woman, man, and child are Sivasaami's wife, Pachaiyamma, her brother Murugesan and daughter Lakshmi. They also had an older son called Velmurugan. They are a family of farmers living in Thekkoor (lit. southern village). Sivasaami has a close relationship with his older son but is distant, almost abusive with Chidambaram. Sivasami's family, along with most residents of Thekkoor, are Dalits. Narasimhan is an upper-caste landlord from Vadakoor (lit. northern village), who needs Sivasaami's 3 acres of land for a factory, to which the family is against selling, especially Velmurugan.
